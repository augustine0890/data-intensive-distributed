# DevOps

## Why DevOps?
- Approach 1: 
    - Understand the requirements
    - Write the perfect code once - software
    - Deploy in on very powerful server
    - Fire the SW team
- Software development is a continuous life long process not one time.
- Testing needs to be the first thing not last.
- DevOps: <--> Plan <--> Build <--> Test <--> Release <--> Monitor <-->

## Understanding DevOps
- Plan: shorter goal planning. A scrum or agile planning is a better choice.
