**Big Data Technologies**
- Hadoop: an open-source software framework used to store and process huge amounts of data.
    - Storage: principally employing the Hadoop File System (HDFS)
    - Resource management and scheduling for computatinal tasks
    - Distributed processing programming model based on MapReduce
    - Common utilites and software libraries necessary for the entire Hadoop platform
- __Rack__: collection of 30-40 nodes that are physically stored close together and are all connected to the same network switch
- Hadoop Cluster: collection of racks
- Data lakes are a method of storing data that keep vast amounts of raw data in their native format and more horizontally to support the analysis of originally disparate sources of data
- Data warehouses:
    - Deliver deep insight with advanced in-database analytics and operational analytics
    - Provide online analytic processing (or OLAP)
